    "Because of VOQC's interoperability with Cirq and Qiskit, it is now possible to pass a Qiskit circuit object through the VOQC optimizations and receive an optimized Qiskit circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The VOQC transpiler can be called similarly to Qiskit's built-in transpiler passes (e.g. \"Commutative Cancellation\" and \"CX Cancellation\"). **VOQC(\\[*list of optimizations*\\])** can be appended to a pre-defined **Pass Manager** with \"list of optimizations\" being an optional argument used to run one or more of the unitary optiizations in VOQC (see *Running Individual Unitary Optimizations*). Appending **VOQC()**, without the argument, will run VOQC's primary optimization function, a specific order of the unitary optimizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first example, we will pass a basic Qiskit circuit to VOQC without the optional list argument, taking advantage of VOQC's main optimization function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first create a four-qubit circuit with 2 NOT gates, 2 hadamard gates, and a CNOT gate. Given this sample circuit **circ**, we define a Pass Manager **pm** to schedule our VOQC transpiler pass. Then, we can append the VOQC transpiler pass to **pm** without an argument, **VOQC()**. Finally, we run our initial circuit **circ** through the primary VOQC optimization and receive and print our optimized circuit **new_circ**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We began with a circuit consisting of 5 gates, but have reduced it to just a singular gate. Now, we will go into more detail on the specifics of each individual optimization.\n"
