    "Welcome to VOQC, a verified optimizer for quantum circuits! This tutorial aims to introduce you to the different optimizations and transformations in VOQC and how to take advantage of them in Qiskit, with VOQC’s interoperability. You can now build a quantum circuit in Qiskit and optimize it through VOQC, with one or more of its unitary optimizations, just like Qiskit’s built-in optimizations. \n",

Appending **VOQC()**, without the argument, will run VOQC's primary optimization function, a specific order of the unitary optimizations. \n",

    "\n",
    "In our first example, we will pass a basic Qiskit circuit to VOQC without the optional list argument, taking advantage of VOQC's main optimization function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first create a four-qubit circuit with 2 NOT gates, 2 hadamard gates, and a CNOT gate. Given this sample circuit **circ**, we define a Pass Manager **pm** to schedule our VOQC transpiler pass. Then, we can append the VOQC transpiler pass to **pm** without an argument, **VOQC()**. Finally, we run our initial circuit **circ** through the primary VOQC optimization and receive and print our optimized circuit **new_circ**.  \n",
